# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It was created as part of my learning journey to practice **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **basic JavaScript logic**.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Interactive UI with buttons for user input
- ✅ Computer randomly selects its move
- ✅ Displays result (win/lose/draw) instantly
- ✅ Score tracking (optional, if implemented)
- ✅ Responsive layout (optional)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with the DOM using `querySelector` and `addEventListener`
- Handling user interactions without page reloads
- Using conditionals and functions to implement game logic
- Understanding how frontend apps update in real-time

---

## 🚫 Limitations

- ❌ No animations or sound effects
- ❌ No localStorage (score resets on reload)
- ❌ Not extensible for complex rules like "Lizard-Spock"
- ❌ UI could be improved with better styling and UX feedback

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add simple animations or sound for better feedback
- Store scores using `localStorage`
- Upgrade UI with transitions and colors
- Rebuild using React to practice component-based architecture
- Multiplayer or online version with WebSockets (stretch goal)
